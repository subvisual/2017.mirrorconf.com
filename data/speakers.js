      <Title>Let's Work Together!</Title>
      <Text>Nobody works alone in a vacuum, and successful work hinges on how well a team communicates and collaborates with each other. This talk will explore many methods, tools, and techniques teams use to produce great web experiences. How do front-end development teams make sure they write clean and consistent code together? How do designers ensure colors, typography, and other design elements are used correctly? What deliverables should be created in an effective web design process? How are decisions communicated with the team, stakeholders, and the broader organization? There are no “right” answers to these questions, but this talk will cover some important principles and helpful tactics to help your team make great work together.</Text>

      <Title>Home</Title>
      <Text>“Home” is a talk about users’ digital life and designers’ roles in shaping them for the best. Home, understood as “the place where one lives permanently as a member of a household” is no longer a physical space for a vast group of people. Many of us find comfort in digital environments and use them for work and leisure and sometimes support.This talk aims to dig deeper into that relationship over time and discuss the key factors that will help designers keep and improve that connection between their products and their users.</Text>

      <Title>How to Tell When You're Tired</Title>
      <Text>The most famous story about work comes from Greek myth: Sisyphus woke each morning to push a rock up a mountain, then the next day found the rock back at the bottom, his progress gone and the challenge reset. After 20 years of making websites, his story sounds familiar to me. If expertise is impossible because everything changes so frequently, how does a person develop wisdom about their work? How do you not burn out? Are these silly questions? Maybe, but change begins with diligent effort and a new perspective on the work.</Text>

      <Text>Although I wasn't meant to design and even less for the web, I am nevertheless Design Director and co-founder of Dogstudio, an international award-winning firm devoted to design, technology and all shades between those two disciplines. Over the last decade, I have worked to spread a culture of design based on quality, emotion and a sense of detail. It lead us to national and international collaborations with Microsoft, The Kennedy Center Washington, The Museum of Science and Industry of Chicago, Franco Dragone, and many others.</Text>
      <Title>Design for Emotion</Title>
      <Text>If you're a designer in 2017, chances are you fully integrate data and KPI in your daily life. That being said, if design’s first role is all about solving issues and making everybody's life easier through on point and smart decisions, we, at the very core of our human nature, are totally illogical and emotion-driven creatures. Let's break things, do a bit of neuroscience, and explore a painting-inspired take on the interactive design process.</Text>

      <Title>Evaluating Technology</Title>
      <Text>We work with technology every day. And every day it seems like there’s more and more technology to understand: graphic design tools, build tools, frameworks and libraries, not to mention new HTML, CSS and JavaScript features landing in browsers. How should we best choose which technologies to invest our time in? When we decide to weigh up the technology choices that confront us, what are the best criteria for doing that? This talk will help you evaluate tools and technologies in a way that best benefits the people who use the websites that we are designing and developing. Let’s take a look at some of the hottest new web technologies like service workers and web components. Together we will dig beneath the hype to find out whether they will really change life on the web for the better.</Text>

There will be plenty of practical tips for you to use in your projects today.</Text>

      <Title>A Little Story About A Big Bang Redesign (Smashing Magazine’s 2017 Relaunch, a Case Study</Title>
      <Text>You’ve been there: big bang redesigns are usually a very, very bad idea. Redesigning and rebuilding an existing website from scratch is risky and unpredictable, and in many cases the level of complexity is highly underrated and underestimated. In mid-2016, Smashing Magazine has decided to make a big switch from the existing WordPress setup to an entirely new design, entirely new architecture (JAM Stack) and an entirely new, GitHub-based, editorial workflow.</Text>
      <Text>In this talk, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief and co-founder of Smashing Magazine, will share some of the insights into Smashing Magazine’s Relaunch in 2017 — with decisions made, failures, successes, lessons learned and shady’n'dirty techniques used along the way. Among other things, you’ll learn how Smashing Magazine uses HTTP/2, service workers and server-less architecture with static site generators to boost performance, with a dash of React, Preact, CSS Grid, calc(), a bit dirty CSS and the peek into the new GitHub-based editorial workflow here and there. Beware: the session will contain at least 27 illustrations of cats!</Text>
      <Text>Keep in mind: you won’t be able to unsee the things you’ll see in this session. Yes, it’s going to be dirty, tricky and horribly annoying at times. You’ll leave with a toolbox of practical techniques that you’ll be able to apply to your work right away. And potentially some tips for saving money on airfare, too!</Text>
